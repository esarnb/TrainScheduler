Want to try it out? Visit [my deployment](https://esarnb.github.io/TrainScheduler/).


## Getting Started

To run this on your local machine, you may download all folders and the index.html. Open the index.html with your preferred browser to initialize the website.

* You must have a persistent internet connection to save and load train data!

### Installing

To deploy on a live system, such as your website, you will need a web server [like Apache2 for Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-16-04).

Then place the folders and files in the subfolder of your choice within the html root directory.

If you would like to have your own database list of trains, you would need to create a firebase realtime app and authentication key. You may find a [tutorial here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup/).
